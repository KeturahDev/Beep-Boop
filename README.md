By Keturah Howard, January 24th 2020

## Description
  This application will take any numberical input and feed back to you a very strange string of values includning *'beeps'* and *'boops'* and phrases alike. Can you crack the code of what this whacky program is doing? I had to. This is a Friday project assigned by Epicodus to practice branching, loops, and other fun stuff covered in previous projects.
