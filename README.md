# Beep Boop
By Keturah Howard, January 24th 2020

## Description
  This application will take any numberical input and feed back to you a very strange string of values includning *'beeps'* and *'boops'* and phrases alike. Can you crack the code of what this whacky program is doing? I had to. This is a Friday project assigned by Epicodus to practice branching, loops, and other fun stuff covered in previous projects.

## Behavioral Driven Development
  *Heres a list of the specific behaviors I wanted to be acheived throughout the development process, starting from most basic to complex.*

  - program only accepts numbers as inputs:
    - input: 'hello'
    - output: 'Please input a number'
  - program only accepts one singular number:
    - input: '25 4 987'
    - output: 'Please input a single number'
  - program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users number:
    - input: '6'
    - output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  - program replaces numbers that contain 1 with beep:
    - input: '11'
    - output: 0, 'beep', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 'beep' 'beep'
  - program replaces numbers that contain 2 with boop:
    - input: '12'
    - output: 0, 'beep', 'boop', 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 'beep', 'beep', 'boop'
  - program replaces numbers that contain 3 with "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.":
    - input: '24'
    - output: 0, 'beep', 'boop', "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 'beep', 'beep', 'boop', "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.", 'beep', 'beep', 'beep', 'beep', 'beep', 'beep', 'boop', 'boop', 'boop', "I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.", 'boop'
